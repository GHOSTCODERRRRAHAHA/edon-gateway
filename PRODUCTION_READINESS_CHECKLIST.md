# EDON Gateway - Production Readiness Checklist

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY**  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

---

## Overview

This checklist outlines the steps needed to make EDON Gateway production-ready for end users. The system has a solid foundation, but several areas need attention before public release.

---

## One-Click Readiness Tools

Use these scripts to provision credentials and run the full production safety regression suite:

- `one_click_prod_readiness.ps1` — health checks + regression tests
- `provision_credentials.ps1` — push tool credentials to the gateway

Example:
```
.\provision_credentials.ps1
.\one_click_prod_readiness.ps1
```

Both scripts read `EDON_GATEWAY_URL` and `EDON_API_TOKEN` from your environment.

## ✅ Already Complete

### Core Features
- ✅ Edonbot integration and proxy endpoint
- ✅ Policy packs (Personal Safe, Work Safe, Ops/Admin)
- ✅ Anti-bypass security (network gating, token hardening)
- ✅ Safety UX dashboard (React UI integrated)
